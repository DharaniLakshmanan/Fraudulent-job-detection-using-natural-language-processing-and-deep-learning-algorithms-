Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking!

We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us.

              "       \"A Unique Job With a Great Company\\r\\nDo you want an exciting job you love, working with other superstars? Are you excited by making a real difference with our team? Join us as our Online Systems Manager!We’re a unique and innovative marketing technology & services company… And we’re growing!\\r\\nOur Online Systems Manager position is a key role in our company, because you’ll be in charge of the online tools we use to service our clients, as well as promote our own services.\\r\\nWhat Do We Do?\\r\\nOur company has offers marketing technology and services to attorneys. We've created a proprietary combination of technology, marketing creative, and business processes that allow lawyers to plug in to our systems very quickly, and stop worrying where their next client will come from. Our customers are great people who are a pleasure to work with – and we become real partners to their business, helping them meet their goals by providing something they want and need.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Will You Do?\\r\\nAs an Online Systems Manager, you will do two things:\\r\\n1) Work directly with our US-Based Client Services Managers to configure and maintain systems to deliver marketing services to our clients. Our Client Services Managers work directly with our attorney clients, and you'll support them in that effort.\\r\\n2) Assist with configuring marketing systems for our own marketing campaigns - the ones which bring customers to us. You'll help manage our markting automation, email campaigns, website, blog, webinars, etc.\\r\\nWhile this is not a programming job, you should be comfortable with the basic configuration of online tools. If you are comfortable deploying a Wordpress site, including adding themes and plugins, and doing basic HTML/CSS then you'll do fine. We can teach you all the other systems. If you're not completely comfortable with this level of technical configuration, then this probably isn't a fit.\\r\\nIf you are experienced with configuring marketing automation systems (such as Infusionsoft, Office Autopilot/Ontraport, etc) then you are very qualified.\\r\\nWorking With Us\\r\\nOur offices are in San Francisco, CA, but you may work remotely anywhere in the world so long as your work day overlaps with our work day (9am - 5pm Pacific) by at least two hours every work day. \\r\\nThis is a full time position. Applicants are expected to not have any other employment, freelance or otherwise.\\r\\nOur Hiring Process\\r\\nOur hiring process is different. That’s because we’re serious about a long-term partnership with you, and we’re willing to put in the time up front to ensure it’s a fit for both of us. That also means you’ll need to put in extra time as well, but as a result you’ll know whether this is the place for you.\\r\\nOur process is designed to find superstars who want to work with other superstars. People interested in a fundamentally different organization where everyone is motivated for excellence, and everyone gets to work on things which make the most of their abilities.\\r\\nBut, you can’t tell who’s a superstar from a resume, and it doesn’t come across in a short interview either.\\r\\nSo our process is designed to let you get to know us, and us to get to know you, before we move on to meeting in person or via video call. We typically screen over 130 applicants before we hire someone because we’re looking for the best candidate – and one who’s also motivated to work with top-performing colleagues.\\r\\nAs you read this process, do not get intimidated. The first steps are intended to give you a picture of who we are and what we do, so you can get a feel for what it’s like working with us. As the process goes along further, it gets more personal. If it’s a fit then rest assured you’ll have more than enough time to get all the information you need and speak personally with us to make a good decision for you.\\r\\nStep 1. First, you’ll fill in an application, with a little information about you. As a part of this application, you’ll be asked to answer a few questions, and also shoot us a quick video introducing yourself (60-90 seconds) so we can get a better idea of who you are. We don’t care about the quality of the video, we just want to see how you communicate since you’ll be working remotely and communication is very important for success in this role.\\r\\nStep 2. If your application looks like a fit, we’ll send you a series of videos about our company and its products. Watch those videos to get a sense for the problems we’re solving, and why lawyers want our solution. Then we'll ask you how your experience fits with the products you learned about in the videos.\\r\\nStep 3. Our recruiter will be in touch to request other information, do a phone/skype screening call, and discuss next steps.\\r\\nYou should not contact the company outside this process.\",\n",

Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is.
